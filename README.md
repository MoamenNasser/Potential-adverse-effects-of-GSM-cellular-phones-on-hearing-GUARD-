# Potential-adverse-effects-of-GSM-cellular-phones-on-hearing-GUARD-
The main goal of the Guard project was to detect the changes, if any, in hearing associated with the low intensity use of GSM mobile phones. To answer this question a team of specialists in biology, biomedicine, engineering and physics was assembled. The project was in action between 2002 and 2004.
